# Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) Control Simulation ðŸš€

Welcome to the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) Control Simulation repository! This simulation allows you to experience controlling an EKV in a realistic 3D environment using Python and Pygame.

## Features

- Realistic 3D environment simulation with dynamic physics.
- Intuitive keyboard controls for movement and rotation.
- Dynamic speed adjustment for precise control.
- Visual representation of the EKV with a forward edge indicator.

## Installation

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/EKV_Control_Simulation.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd EKV_Control_Simulation
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required Python packages using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pygame
     ```

4. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you encounter any issues during installation or execution, try the following troubleshooting commands:
     - **Update pip:** If you're experiencing issues with pip, try updating it to the latest version:
       ```bash
       pip install --upgrade pip
       ```
     - **Check Python Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible version of Python (recommended: Python 3.x):
       ```bash
       python --version
       ```
     - **Reinstall Dependencies:** If installation fails, try reinstalling the dependencies:
       ```bash
       pip install --force-reinstall pygame
       ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Execute the Python script to start the simulation:
     ```bash
     python ekv_control_simulation.py
     ```
   - The simulation window will open, and you can control the EKV using the keyboard commands.

2. **Controls:**
   - **W/S:** Increase/Decrease Speed
   - **A/D:** Rotate Left/Right

3. **Enjoy Exploring!**
   - Use the controls to navigate the EKV in the 3D environment.
   - Experiment with different speeds and rotations to master the control.
